## Pharmacy-Management-System

    The Pharmacy Management System is a Python-based application for managing pharmacy inventory. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing           various tasks related to medicines, such as adding, deleting, editing, selling, and displaying the inventory.


# Features 

    Add Medicine: Easily add new medicines to the inventory, providing details like name, cost, quantity, type, and brand.
    
    Delete Medicine: Remove medicines from the inventory by specifying their names.
    
    Edit Medicine: Update the details of existing medicines, including cost, quantity, type, and brand.
    
    Sell Medicine: Record sales of medicines by specifying the name and quantity sold, and it will automatically update the inventory.
    
    Display Inventory: View the entire inventory, search for specific medicines, and sort the list alphabetically or by the order they were added.


# Requirements

    Tkinter (usually included with Python) if not use pip install tkinter
    Pillow (PIL) for handling images (optional, install via pip install Pillow)
    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    
    If you want to use background images, install the Pillow (PIL) library using the following command:
    pip install Pillow
    Create or provide a data file named "pharmacy_data.json" for storing medicine inventory. The program will load and save data to this file.


# Usage
    Run the program by executing the provided Python script:
    python pharmacy_management_system.py
    The GUI application will open, and you can start managing your pharmacy inventory.


# Troubleshooting
    If you encounter issues with tkinter not being available or other package-related problems, make sure you've installed Python and any required packages as          mentioned in the Requirements section.
    
    Check file paths for images and data files to ensure they are correctly specified in your code.
    The json file and the background image should be in the same directory where your python file is present.
